Keeping notes on how to express.js

To build an express.js app: 
1 - Create a package.json file using "npm init"
2 - install express.js locally with the cmd : npm install express.js --save.
3 - install nodemon locally : npm install nodemon --save. (Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development.)
4 - add Express to the dependencies. 
5 - create an index.js file.
6 - follow along the index.js file.
7 - run the command 'nodemon index.js'
8 - Oppen in your browser the page 'localhost:3000' and here is your first express.js file running!
